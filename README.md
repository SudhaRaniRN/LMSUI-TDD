# LMS-UI

In order to deliver a robust and user-friendly Learning Management System (LMS) UI, I adopted a dual approach, 
incorporating both Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) methodologies throughout the development lifecycle.
This approach allowed me to systematically and comprehensively test the UI to ensure its reliability and adherence to user requirements.

In the TDD phase, I followed a structured process that began with the creation of test cases before writing the actual code.
These tests were designed to validate the functionality of specific UI components and features.

In the BDD phase, I shifted my focus towards testing the overall behavior and user interactions of the LMS UI. 
I created feature files using Gherkin language, which served as executable specifications of the UI's behavior.
